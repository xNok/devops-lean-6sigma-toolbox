# DevOps Lean Six Sigma Toolbox

Selecting the proper methodology for each type of project is key when leading changes. In the industrial engineering world, changes are driven by the Improvement Model that is often referred to as PDCA (Plan, Do, Check, Act). The strength of this approach is a scientific problem-solving mindset and the numerous tools born to solve common types of problems.

Over the years, Lean and Six Sigmas practitioners have built an impressive library of toolboxes (A3,
Value Stream Mapping, 5S, Kanban, and so on).

I believe that a lot of those toolboxes could be repurposed to serve the DevOps culture and methodologies. This is my attempt.
